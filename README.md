#Kudu Engine

Kudu is a game engine written in python (compatible with 2-3), depending on python-sfml (pygame if not found) and Box2D. It can be embed in Pookoo engine.

It use JSON to store game data like the structure of level and the images of the player animation, or the GUI.

Documentation [here](http://team-kwakwa.com/kudu_doc/index.html)

###Install
Install [python-sfml](http://www.python-sfml.org/)
(or [pygame](http://www.pygame.org/), but deprecated )
and [Box2D](http://code.google.com/p/pybox2d/)

### Create game project
- Create an init JSON file in data/json/init.json who will look like this:
``` {
	"init": "data/json/level.json",
	"screen_size": [1280,720]
} ```

- Create a level JSON file:
``` {
	"images": {
	},
	"physic_object": {
	}
} ```

### Build executable on windows
Use cx_Freeze with this setup file:
``` import sys
from cx_Freeze import setup, Executable
build_exe_options = {"includes":["numbers","re"], "excludes":["sfml"]}
base = None
setup(  name = "Kudu",
        version = "0.1",
        description = "My GUI application!",
        options = {"build_exe": build_exe_options},
        executables = \[Executable("main.py", base=base)\]) ```

You should now put the sfml folder from C:\PythonXX\Lib\site-package\sfml into the folder containing the executable.
Then ``` python setup.py build ```


###TODO
- Editor
- GUI element
- Custom init creation at start
